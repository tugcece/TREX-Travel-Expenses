# TREX-Travel-Expenses-

Trex is an application that shows how much fuel expenses you will spend with selected vehicles between the destination and origin(starting point). The application is coding with React Native and Expo(https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

You need GOOGLE API KEY, COLLECTAPI API KEY(https://collectapi.com/api/gasPrice/gas-prices-api), and TRAVELPAYOUTS API KEY(https://passport.travelpayouts.com/) to run the app.
It's not the final version. It is under development.
